# odin-recipes
In this project I am practicing the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far.
I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will consist 
of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 

Skills I have demonstrated by completing this basic website:
• I wrote the basic boilerplate for an HTML document,
• I created
  ◦ headings and paragraphs,
  ◦ unordered and ordered lists,
  ◦ as well as links to other pages on my own website,
• I also displayed images on certain webpages.
